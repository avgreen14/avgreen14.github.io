      Hello! My name is Alex Green. I live in Tennessee. One of my hobbies is
      playing guitar! I first started playing guitar when my parents bought me
      one in 2008. I have loved learning new songs that have challenged me and
      kept my occupied for hours. My favorite website is
      <a class="espn" href="https://www.espn.com/" target="_blank">ESPN</a>
      mainly for fantasy football. I currently work as a pharmacy technician for
      Walgreens and have worked there for the past 2 years.

      I would like to get into web design and development because it feels like
      making art with a computer. Designing and coding a webpage that people can
      go to and get information about what's going on in the world or designing
      a sports page that can distribute knowledge to fans. Getting information
      out on the web that is easily accessible is key to communication between
      ordinary people from around the world.
